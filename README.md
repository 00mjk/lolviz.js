> A small set of functions that display simple data structures and arbitrary object graphs including lists, dictionaries, linked-lists, binary trees and function call stacks (not implemented) in a reasonable manner using [viz.js](https://github.com/mdaines/viz.js/) (graphviz for the web). A Javascript data-structure visualization tool, ported from https://github.com/parrt/lolviz

For more information please check the [original project page](https://github.com/parrt/lolviz)

[![Live demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Live%20demo-%E2%86%92-9D6EB3.svg?style=flat-square)](https://websemantics.github.io/lolviz.js)

Also, see [examples](https://websemantics.github.io/lolviz.js/examples.html)

## Assumptions

This implementation makes the assumption that Javascript `Map` and `Set` types are sufficient replacement for Python `dict` and `tuple` types respectively.

A reminder of the definitions of few Python collections (arrays),

* List       : Ordered and changeable collection (Allows duplicate)
* Tuple      : Ordered and unchangeable collection (Allows duplicate)
* Set        : Unordered and unindexed collection (No duplicates)
* Dictionary : Unordered, changeable and indexed collection (No duplicates)

Mapping of types between Javascript and Python is tricky (huh, who knew!) and it's likely that there're better ways to do that. So, please feel free to send comments and suggestions.

## Tensors

This implementation includes an implementation to visualize Tensors (Scalar, Vector, Matrix and `n` rank Tensor).

## Appearance

I've made an attempt in this project to make few style changes to graphviz generated SVG images to enhance the visualization apperance.

This was achieved by making few tweaks to the original code to accumodate changes to color and style (line thickness for example) in addition to making direct changes to the SVG DOM of the generated images.

Here's an example of the three styles that can be achived (fancy, b&w and classic),

## Libraries

Included in this project the following support libraries,

#### Python.js

Approximal implementations of some of [Python built-in functions](https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html) and a few extra helpers.

* id         : Generate an id
* escape     : Escape HTML entities
* stringify  : Enhanced JSON.stringify function
* repr       : Get a printable representation of an object
* str        : Get a nicely printable representation of an object
* hasattr    : Check if an object’s contains a specific attribute
* isinstance : Check if an object is an instance of provided type
* list       : Convert a 'set', 'map' or an object to keys array
* ord        : Get the char code of the first character of a string
* chr        : Get the character of a char code
* array      : Get an empty array for the given size
* range      : Iterate over the given range (from, to)
* flat       : A variant of 'str' function
* chunk      : Split an array into chunks
* len        : Get variable size (set, map, array or object)

#### Type.js

A tiny libary to work with Javascript types including a built-in support for ducktyping.

* type : Return variable type as a string
* is   : Check for a variable type
* as   : Check for a variable ducktype
* ctor : Get a variable class name

#### SVG.js

SVG helper library to create/manipulate SVG DOM elements.

#### Fancy.js

Custom DOM-Stylier for the SVG images generated by Viz.js.

#### Highlight.js

Super tiny Javascript code highlighter for the demo page.
